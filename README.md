## ðŸ”– Layout

During the development process, I drew inspiration from various sources to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. The login/signup interface closely resembles the example provided by [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), while the home page layout adapts elements from the Tasks interface of the same source. By leveraging these inspirations, I aimed to create a cohesive and intuitive design for Task Manager while adding my unique touches and customizations.
